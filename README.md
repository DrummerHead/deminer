# Deminer
## Robots are better are finding mines

Take the contents of [deminer.min.js](https://github.com/DrummerHead/deminer/blob/master/deminer.min.js) and paste it to [mcdlr.com/js-inject](http://mcdlr.com/js-inject/) to quickly get a bookmarklet

Use this bookmarklet on http://minesweeperonline.com/ , click on the board until you have an opening, now click `j` on your keyboard. While the algorithm is working, the borders of the board will be red, when it's your turn to make a decision when an ambiguous case is found, the borders of the board will be green. Make your move and press `j` again until you loose or win.

You can also interact with the board while the algorithm is making it's thing, if you see pools of ambiguity.

My record for solving an expert minesweeper board with this bookmarklet is 4 seconds (yey)
